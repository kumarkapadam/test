software testing terminology::
=============================
Regression testing::
-------------------
Testing conducts on modified build to make sure there will  not be impact on
existing functionality because of changes like adding/deleting /modifying features

Unit Regression testing:::
    testing only the changes /modifications done by the developer
Regional Regression Testing:
    testing the modified module along with the impacted modules
    impact analysis meeting conducts to identify impacted modules with QA & DEV
Full Regression:::
    testing the main feature @ remaining part of the application
    ex:: dev has done changes in many modules , instead of identifying impacted modules
    we perform one round of full  regression


Re_testing:::(verifiong in thwe bugss)
===============
----> whennever the developer fixed bug, testing will test the bug fix is called re_testing
----> tester close the bug  if it worked otherwise re-open and send to developer
----> to  ensure that the defects which were found asnd posted in the earlier build were fixed or nor in the current build
-----> example
        __build 1.0 was released test team found some defects  and posted
        --> build 1.1 was released , now testing the defectss 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 in this build is retesting




example:
=========
An application under test has three modules namely Admin,purchase and finance

finance module depends on purchase module
if a tester a found a bug on purchase module and posted
once the bug is fixed , the tester needs to do retesting to verify wherher th e bug related to the purchase is fixed or not and
also tester needs to do tegreession testing to test the finance module which depends on the purchase module


                    admin

                     purchase

                       nance



smoke tessting :

smoke testing is done to make sure the build
tester ----- installed or not  verifie
build verification testing --- smoke testing
sanity testing always developed tester





smoke testing is done to  make sure the build we received from the development team is testable /stable or not

smoke testing is performed by both developers and testers

smoke testing ,build may be either stable or unstable

it is a part of basic testing

usually it is done every time there is a new build release



sanity testing :
==============

sanity test is done during the release phase to check for the main functionalities of the application without going deeper



exploratory testing :
====================
we have to explore the application ,unserstand m completely and test it

understand the application , identify all possible scenarios , document it then use it for testing

we do exploratory testing when the application ready but there is no requirement

test engineer will do exploratory testing when there is no requirement

Drawbacks :
===========
you might misuderstand any feature as bug or any as feature since you do not have requitement

time consuming

if there is any bug in appliction , you will never know about it

adhoc testing ::
===================

testing application randomly without ant restcases or any busiess requirement document

adhoc testing is an informal testing type with an aim to break the system

tester should have knowledge of application even thou he doesn't have requirement / test cases

this testing is usually an unplanned activity



money testing / gorilla testing
====================================

testing application randomly without any test cases or any business requirement document

adhoc testing is an informal testing type with an aim to break the system

tester do not have knowledge of application

suitable for gaming application
